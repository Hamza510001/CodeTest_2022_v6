X.
What makes this code amazing is that it follows Separation of concerns principles i.e seperation of controller and service because

a) Controller which is primarily interested in handling incoming http request and responding back to that request. We are worried about things related to handling stuff related to a given communication channel.
b) Business logic as such does not care about how you are communicating this data to end users. So you take it out and keep in one common place that only deals with business logic i.e seprate service or repository
c) Blueprint (BaseRepository) for extension in which any model can be injected and reused 


-----------------------------

Y.

a) Code is in its best form it can be 
b) it doesnt need refactoring as its properly formated, scoped, utilized and logged
c) no redundant query inside loop which can be refactored
d) although all controllers should have exception handeling just for safe side but it is present where needed.
